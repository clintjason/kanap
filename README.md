# Kanap #

The aim of this project is to develop a frontend website based on Vanilla JS to interact with Backend API services.
This demonstrates the use of OOP JS, ES6, REST API Request Consumption.

### Front end Installation ###
Just run the frontend using live server of VSCODE. The project won't work if accessed on the local filesystem
as it's coded in modules. You must serve the front-end from a server and navigate to the url /html/index.html
