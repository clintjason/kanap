The aim of this project is to develop a frontend website based on Vanilla JS to interact with Backend API services.
This demonstrates the use of OOP JS, ES6, REST API Request Consumption.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### Front end Installation ###
Just run the frontend using live server of VSCODE. The project won't work if accessed on the local filesystem
as it's coded in modules. You must serve the front-end from a server and navigate to the url frontend/html/index.html
